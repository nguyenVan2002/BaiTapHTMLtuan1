    <h3 id="url">URLS</h3>
    <p>
        URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. A URL is nothing more than the address of a given unique resource on the Web. In theory, each valid URL points to a unique resource. Such resources can be an HTML page, a CSS document, an image, etc. In practice,
        there are some exceptions, the most common being a URL pointing to a resource that no longer exists or that has moved. As the resource represented by the URL and the URL itself are handled by the Web server, it is up to the owner of the web server
        to carefully manage that resource and its associated URL.

    <h3 id="source">Source Anchors</h3>
    <p>
        A link has two ends — called anchors — and a direction. The link starts at the “source” anchor and points to the “destination” anchor, which may be any Web resource (e.g., an image, a video clip, a sound bite, a program, an HTML document, an element within
        an HTML document, etc.).
